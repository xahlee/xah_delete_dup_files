* Delete Duplicate Files

A Perl script that delete duplicate files in a dir and all subdirs.

The perl version is in subdir 〔del_dup_perl〕

Type 「perl del_dup.pl」 to see help.

Typically works on a dir with 30 thousand files. It minimizes comparison. Only files that are exactly identical are deleted.

There's also a Python version. (but haven't been heavily tested)
The Python version is at 〔del_dup_python〕

There's also a Java version. (but i think it's incomplete.)
